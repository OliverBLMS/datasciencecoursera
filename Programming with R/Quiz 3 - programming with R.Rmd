# 1
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(iris)

aggregate(. ~ Species, data = iris, mean)
sapply(tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean), round)

```

# 2
```{r}
apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean)
```

# 3
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)

sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)
with(mtcars, tapply(mpg, cyl, mean))
```


# 4
Continuing with the 'mtcars' dataset from the previous Question, what is the absolute difference between the average horsepower of 4-cylinder cars and the average horsepower of 8-cylinder cars?
```{r}
result <- with(mtcars, tapply(hp, cyl, mean))
round(abs(result[1] - result[3]))
```

# 5
```{r}
debug(ls)
ls
```
